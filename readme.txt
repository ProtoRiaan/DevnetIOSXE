Playing around with Netconf Client preparing for Devnet Cert Exam.

Ran into some issues connecting to the 'reccommended' code sandbox. Verified it was having an authentication error with some SSH testing. Reached out to the Devnet team for assist. The verified the sandbox was undergoing maintenance
They provided a link and new credentials to use on the "latest" code sandbox. Tested today and it is working well. 

Thus far I am able to get and print a list of the capabiliteis and also grab and print the running config in xml and print it to a file for review.
